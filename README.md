### Short bio

:construction_worker: I am a professor of economics at [Department_of_Industrial_and_Information_Engineering_and_Economics](https://www.univaq.it/rubrica.php?id=1091&docente=on) of the University of Lâ€™Aquila, where I teach and conduct research on macroeconomics, economic modeling, monetary economics, and theory of value and distribution. In addition, I lead and coordinate the EU-funded project *A JUst Transition to the Circular Economy* ([JUST2CE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GffG1JgjRxU)) at the [University of Leeds](https://business.leeds.ac.uk/divisions-economics/staff/145/marco-veronese-passarella). I am a senior visiting research fellow at [Angelo_King_Institute](https://www.dlsu-aki.com/) of the De La Salle University of Manila. Lastly, I am a member of the *Collegio dei Docenti* of the [PhD_Programme_in_Social_Sciences](https://www.unipd.it/dottoratoscheda/social-sciences) at the University of Padua. 

:closed_book: While I was trained in neoclassical economics, I have since questioned the dominant (individual scarcity-based) approach and instead advocate for a macro-monetary reproduction paradigm. My economics pantheon includes a diverse range of scholars, such as David Ricardo, Karl Marx, Rosa Luxemburg, Joan Robinson, Nicholas Kaldor, Michal Kalecki, Piero Sraffa, Hyman Minsky, Richard Goodwin, Paolo Sylos-Labini, Wynne Godley, and Augusto Graziani.

:chart_with_upwards_trend: In terms of programming languages and environments, I mainly use `R` and `EViews`. However, I have a basic kwnoledge of `Python` and `Matlab` as well.

:family: On a personal note, I am married to Marica Grego, who holds a research fellow position at the University of Pavia, and we have a daughter named Alice.
