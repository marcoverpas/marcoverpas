### From Marx till `R`

ðŸŽ“ I am an associate professor at the *Department of Industrial and Information Engineering and Economics* of the [University_of_Lâ€™Aquila](https://ec.univaq.it/index.php?id=veronesepassarella), where I teach and conduct research on macroeconomics, economic modeling, monetary economics, ecological economics, and theory of value and distribution. In addition, I lead and coordinate (as a senior research fellow in economics) the WP5 of the EU-funded project *A JUst Transition to the Circular Economy* ([JUST2CE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GffG1JgjRxU)) at the [University of Leeds](https://business.leeds.ac.uk/divisions-economics/staff/145/marco-veronese-passarella). I am a senior research fellow in macroeconomics at [Angelo_King_Institute](https://www.dlsu-aki.com/) of the *'De La Salle' University of Manila*. Lastly, I am a member of the *Collegio dei Docenti* of the PhD programme in social sciences at the [University_of_Padua](https://www.unipd.it/dottoratoscheda/social-sciences). 

ðŸ“š While I was trained in neoclassical economics, I have since questioned the dominant (subjective scarcity-based) approach and instead advocate for a macro-monetary reproduction paradigm. My economics pantheon includes a diverse range of scholars, such as David Ricardo, Karl Marx, Rosa Luxemburg, Joan Robinson, Nicholas Kaldor, Michal Kalecki, Piero Sraffa, Hyman Minsky, Richard Goodwin, Paolo Sylos-Labini, Wynne Godley, and Augusto Graziani.

:chart_with_upwards_trend: In terms of programming languages and environments, I mainly use `R` and `EViews`. However, I have a good kwnoledge of `Python` and `MATLAB` as well.

:family: On a personal note, I am married to Marica Grego, who holds a research fellow position in business economics at the [University_of_Pavia](https://unipv.unifind.cineca.it/individual?uri=http%3A%2F%2Firises.unipv.it%2Fresource%2Fperson%2F1195970), and we have a daughter named Alice.
