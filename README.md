### From Marx till `R`

ðŸŽ“ I am an associate professor at the [*Department of Industrial and Information Engineering and Economics*](https://ec.univaq.it/index.php?id=veronesepassarella) of the [University of Lâ€™Aquila](https://www.univaq.it/), where I teach and conduct research on macroeconomics, economic modeling, monetary economics, ecological economics, and theory of value and distribution. I am a senior visiting research fellow in economics at the [University of Leeds](https://business.leeds.ac.uk/divisions-economics/staff/145/marco-veronese-passarella), where from 2021 to 2024 I led and coordinated the WP5 of the EU-funded project *A JUst Transition to the Circular Economy* ([JUST2CE](https://github.com/JUST2CE-WP5)). In addition, I am a senior visiting research fellow in macroeconomics at Angelo King Institute of the De La Salle [University of Manila](https://www.dlsu-aki.com/research-fellows-and-staff.html). From 2021 to 2025, I was a member of the academic board of the [PhD programme in social sciences at the University of Padua](https://www.unipd.it/dottoratoscheda/social-sciences). I am currently a member of the academic board of the [PhD Programme in Industrial and Information Engineering and Economics at the University of Lâ€™Aquila](https://diiie.univaq.it/index.php?id=2613&L=1).

ðŸ“š While I was trained in neoclassical economics, I have since questioned the dominant (subjective scarcity-based) approach and instead advocate for a macro-monetary reproduction paradigm. My economics pantheon includes a diverse range of scholars, such as David Ricardo, Karl Marx, Rosa Luxemburg, Joan Robinson, Nicholas Kaldor, Michal Kalecki, Piero Sraffa, Hyman Minsky, Richard Goodwin, Paolo Sylos-Labini, Luigi Pasinetti, Wynne Godley, and Augusto Graziani.

:chart_with_upwards_trend: In terms of programming languages and environments, I mainly use `R` and `EViews`. However, I have a good knowledge of other languages (like `Python`, `MATLAB` and `Julia`) as well.

:family: On a personal note, I am married to Marica Grego, who holds a research fellow position in business economics at the [University_of_Pavia](https://unipv.unifind.cineca.it/individual?uri=http%3A%2F%2Firises.unipv.it%2Fresource%2Fperson%2F1195970), and we have a daughter named Alice.
