I am a professor of economics at Department of Industrial and Information Engineering and Economics of the University of L‚ÄôAquila, where I teach and conduct research on macroeconomics, economic modeling, monetary economics, and theory of value and distribution. In addition, I lead and coordinate the EU-funded project A JUst Transition to the Circular Economy (JUST2CE) at the University of Leeds. I am a senior visiting research fellow at Angelo King Institute of the De La Salle University of Manila. Lastly, I am a member of the ‚ÄúCollegio dei Docenti‚Äù of the PhD Programme in Social Sciences at the University of Padua. My academic qualifications are detailed in my CV.

While I was trained in neoclassical economics, I have since questioned the dominant (individual scarcity-based) approach and instead advocate for a macro-monetary reproduction paradigm. My economics pantheon includes a diverse range of scholars, such as David Ricardo, Karl Marx, Rosa Luxemburg, Joan Robinson, Nicholas Kaldor, Michal Kalecki, Piero Sraffa, Hyman Minsky, Richard Goodwin, Paolo Sylos-Labini, Wynne Godley, and Augusto Graziani.

On a personal note, I am married to Marica Grego, who holds a post-doctoral contract at the University of Pavia, and we have a daughter named Alice. I am an active member of several academic societies, including Economia e Politica, Reteaching Economics, the Italian Post-Keynesian Network, and the Post-Keynesian Economics Society.
